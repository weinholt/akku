.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAkku.scm\fR is a project-based language package manager for R6RS
Scheme. It is mainly meant for schemers who develop programs or
libraries in R6RS Scheme, but could potentially work for end-users of
those programs.
.PP
Project-based means that dependencies are local to each project you
manage with Akku. The idea is that each project will specify its
dependencies through a manifest and a lockfile. When developing on a
project, you set your environment variables by sourcing that project's
activate script into your shell (\fCsource .akku/bin/activate\fR).
This ensures that the code you load into your program is that of your
direct or indirect dependencies, instead of something that just
happened to exist somewhere in your load path.
.PP
A project's direct dependencies are listed in the manifest. By running
a dependency solver, specific versions of those dependencies are
\fIlocked\fR. This means that others who also use your lockfile will
get exactly the same dependencies installed as you had while
developing.
.PP
This manpage mostly goes over the details of the command line
interface, where these command are available:
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
\fBinit\fR \fIdirectory\fR
Initialize a new project with a simple template that demonstrates
a program, a library and a test. This is not necessary to start
using Akku in an existing project. In that case you simply go
to the root directory of the project and start running akku.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B list
List the local package index. For each package in the index it shows
the name (used in command line arguments), the version and a short
synopsis. When used in the project directory it will read the manifest
and the lockfile and use that information to highlight versions that
match the dependencies.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.BI show " pkg"
Display details about a package in the local package index. The first
few sections are for your information only. Any dependencies are
listed together with a simplified version range in braces. The source
code section shows all information that will be used to download the
package when it is installed.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B install \fIpkg\fR[@\fIversion-range\fR].\|.\|.
Running install with a list of packages will add them to the package
manifest, lock dependencies and install everything in the lockfile.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B update
Updates the local package index. The index files are signed with GnuPG
signatures that are verified before they are used.
.IP
This command requires curl.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
\fBadd\fR [\-\-\fBdev\fR] \fIpkg\fR[@\fIversion-range\fR]
Adds a package to the manifest using a version range that allows
forwards-compatible upgrades. Optionally the range can be specified
manually using the \fIpkg\fR@\fIversion-range\fR syntax, e.g.
\fIsemver@^1.0.0\fR. It's also possible to edit the manifest by hand,
but formatting will not be preserved by these commands.
.IP
The \-\-\fBdev\fR option adds the package as a development dependency.
Development dependencies are ignored when the package is used as a
dependency by a third package (they are only needed when doing
development on the current package).
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B lock
Locks dependencies. Runs a dependency solver over the manifest and the
local package index and generates the lockfile. The lockfile contains
the location of each transitive dependency together with a
cryptographic identity.
.IP
It is wise to commit both the manifest and the lockfile in your source
code repository; the lockfile is not used when your package is pulled
in as a dependency.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B install
Without arguments, this command follows the instructions in the
lockfile to download and install the listed projects. A file scanner
looks at each file in the downloaded projects and figures out what
type of source it is and where it goes in the file system.
.IP
This command requires git.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B remove \fIpkg\fR.\|.\|.
Updates the package manifest to remove dependencies, doing the
opposite of add.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B uninstall \fIpkg\fR.\|.\|.
Does three things: removes dependencies from the manifest, locks
dependencies and runs install to remove the files that are no longer
needed.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B version
Print the Akku.scm version number to standard output.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
\fBscan\fR [\fIdirectory\fR]
Scans a directory recursively and analyses all files. The result of
the analysis is printed as a series of YAML documents (syntax might
be a bit off: send bug reports). Useful for figuring out what type
of code Akku thinks the repository contains.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
\fBpublish\fR [\-\-\fBversion\fR=\fIversion\fR] [\-\-\fBtag\fR=\fItag\fR]
Guides you through publishing your package. If there is no manifest
then it first creates a draft that you will need to edit. Otherwise it
generates a package index snippet and asks if you want to submit it.
Have a careful look. If you answer yes then it fires up gpg to sign
the displayed snippet and then it submits the signed snippet to the
server.
.IP
The version to publish is taken from the manifest but can be
overridden by using the \-\-\fBversion\fR=\fIversion\fR option. By
default it looks for a tag named v\fIversion\fR. It is possible to
override the tag using the \-\-\fBtag\fR=\fItag\fR option if the
repository does not use the v1.2.3 tagging scheme. If it does not find
a tag then the published revision will match the current HEAD.
.IP
It is always the lock section of the printed index snippet that will
dictate which revision of your code is associated with the version
you're publishing.
.IP
Note that no matter which revision is published, it is the currently
checked out manifest that will be used to populate the metadata of the
index snippet.
.IP
See section
.B "PUBLISHING PACKAGES"
below for a checklist of things to go through before publishing.
.IP
This command requires gpg, a gpg key and curl.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
.B graph
Runs the repository analyser and prints a digraph of library
dependencies. It's kind of a proof of concept at this point. Example
usage: \fCakku graph | dot -Tx11\fR.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
\fBdependency\-scan\fR [\-\-\fBimplementation\fR=\fIimpl\fR] \fIfilename\fR.\|.\|.
Traces the dependencies of a set of library of program source files.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
\fBlicense\-scan\fR [\-\-\fBimplementation\fR=\fIimpl\fR] \fIfilename\fR.\|.\|.
Does the same dependency scanning as dependency\-scan, but then
searches through all files it finds to look for license notices and
similar legal text. This command is useful as a first step in
gathering notices when distributing a compiled Scheme program.
.IP
Some words are worth repeating here:
this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

GNU General Public License for more details.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.TP
\fBarchive\-scan\fR \fIdirectory\fR.\|.\|.
Scans the given directories for \fC*.akku\fR files and gathers them
into a single index file. This is used at repository servers as part
of maintaining the archive.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.SH "PUBLISHING PACKAGES"
You can make packages available to other users through the central
Akku.scm registry with the \fBpublish\fR command described above. Here
is a checklist of items to consider before publishing:
.
.IP 1.
Check that your manifest is up to date and contains at least the
right package name, version, synopsis, at least one author and a
license identifier. If you don't have a manifest yet, then run
\fCakku publish\fR to get a draft.
.IP 2.
Version numbers must follow the
.UR https://semver.org/
SemVer specification
.UE .
If you are packaging software that does not follow the SemVer rules
then adjust the version numbers so that they follow the rules (they don't
need to match the original software exactly).
.IP 3.
Please pay some attention to the license field to make sure that it is
accurate. Use the identifiers from
.UR https://\:spdx.org/\:licenses/
the SPDX project
.UE ,
making sure to use an open source license.
.IP 4.
Prepare and publish your GnuPG key if you do not yet have one. If
you're not too particular on the details of this and just want a key
that works then you can run \fCgpg \-\-quick-generate-key "Name Goes
Here <schemer@example.com>"\fR, filling in the name and email address
that you want to use. Afterwards you need to publish your key to the
public key servers using the command \fCgpg \-\-keyserver pgp.mit.edu
\-\-send-keys \f[CI]keyID\fR, using the key ID associated with your
new key.
.IP 5.
Currently all projects need to be in a publicly available git
repository, but this will change later. The release should preferably
be tagged using their SemVer version numbers: version 1.0.0 gets
tagged with \fIv1.0.0\fR. You can use \fCgit tag \-s v1.0.0\fR to make
a signed tag (and don't forget to use \fCgit push --tags\fR).
.
.PP
All packages in the index are signed with GnuPG signatures. This
provides important benefits: third parties can verify the package
index and the archive software can verify that a newly uploaded
version came from same author as previously uploaded versions.
.PP
Packages are manually reviewed before they are accepted into the
package index. Ask in #akku on Freenode if there are problems.
.PP
Publishing is meant to be easy and hassle-free after some initial
setup, so please report any usability problems with the publish
command.
.SH BUGS
Implementation-specific language constructs such as modules and
lexical syntax are handled rather poorly.
.PP
The conversion of R7RS code is not complete. It does not add quotes to
vectors, which are self-quoting in R7RS but not in R6RS. If the R7RS
code uses shared data at the lexical level then the written R6RS
library will also use that and may end up not being loadable by a
conformant R6RS implementation. The R7RS support needs the akku\-r7rs
package to be installed.
.PP
The lock command (and any command that uses it behind the scenes) does
not preserve the versions of previously locked packages. This is
planned to be fixed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.\" ------------------------------------------
.SS "Updating the local package index"
.\" ------------------------------------------
Right after installation and before doing anything else, it's a good
idea to update the local package index:
.
.RS
.EX
$ akku update
.EE
.RE
.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.SS "Quick start in a new project"
.\" ------------------------------------------
A quick way to get new dependencies into a project is to use the
\fBinstall\fR command. Have a look at the package list and choose
something you want to install. Afterwards, source the activate
script to get the correct environment variables:
.
.RS
.EX
$ akku list
$ akku install chez-srfi
$ source .akku/bin/activate
.EE
.RE
.
.\" ------------------------------------------
.SS "Install dependencies step-by-step"
.\" ------------------------------------------
Dependencies can be installed step-by-step in order to follow the process:
.
.RS
.EX
$ akku add chez-srfi  # writes Akku.manifest
$ akku lock           # writes Akku.lock
$ akku install        # updates .akku/
.EE
.RE
